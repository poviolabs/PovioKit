/// `AsyncThrottleSequence` is a wrapper around an `AsyncSequence` that introduces a delay between tasks to control the rate at which elements are emitted.
///
/// This struct is available on iOS 16.0 and later.
/// 
/// This is an _async/await_ implementation of `Throttler`.
/// 
/// ## Example:
/// 
///   - **Step 1:** Create an async sequence type which performs the asynchronous operation that you want to throttle:
///   
///       struct SearchAsyncSequence: AsyncSequence {
///         typealias Element = PostsAsyncIterator.Element
///
///         func makeAsyncIterator() -> PostsAsyncIterator {
///           SearchAsyncIterator()
///         }
///       }
///       
///       struct PostsAsyncIterator: AsyncIteratorProtocol {
///         typealias Element = [Item]
///         
///         func next() async throws -> Element? {
///            callSearchAPI(...)
///         // ^~~~~~~~~~~~~^ operation, which will be throttled
///         }
///       }
///   
///   - **Step 2:** Use the decorator to create a throttled async sequence, and use it to perform operations:
///   
///       class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
///         ...
///         private var throttledSearch = SearchAsyncSequence()
///           .throttle(
///             clock: .suspending,
///             delayBetweenTasks: .miliseconds(600)
///           )
///           .makeAsyncIterator()
///         ...
///         
///         @MainActor
///         func search() {
///           Task {
///             guard let results = try await throttledSearch.next() else { return }
///             // ... 
///           }           
///         }
///       }
///
/// ## Parameters:
///   - BaseSequence: The type of the underlying `AsyncSequence`.
///   - C: The type of the `Clock` used to measure the delay between tasks.
