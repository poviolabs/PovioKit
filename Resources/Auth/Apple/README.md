# AppleAuthProvider

Auth provider for social login with Apple.

## Setup
- Open the `Signing & Capabilities` section in **Xcode** target and add `Sign in with Apple` entitlement.
- Navigate to the `Certificates, Identifiers & Profile` section under **Apple Developer** portal, select `Keys` from side menu and create a new key.

- Type in the name like "Sign in with Apple" and select `Sign in with Apple` checkbox

- When integration with Firebase (or any other auth provider as such) youâ€™ll need to create a random string called `nonce` when creating authorization request.
- Integration with custom API is a bit more challenging since you need to create rest call to Apple servers and handle tokenization yourself. You can read more about this [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi).

Please read [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) from Apple for more details around the setup and integration.

## Usage

```swift
let provider = AppleAuthProvider(delegate: self)

// signIn user
provider.signIn() // a delegate method `appleAuthProviderDidSignIn(with:` or `appleAuthProviderDidFail(with:` is called

// get auth status
AppleAuthProvider.checkAuthState() { state in
  print("Is authorized", state)
}

// signOut user
AppleAuthProvider.signOut() // all provider data regarding the use auth is cleared at this point
```
